# Small Project that Simulates PnP Turn Based Battles

### Planned Features:
- PNP-RPG-like cast of characters.
- Battles between your party and set of monsters.
- Short scoped RPG system: skills and traits.
- Short scoped character advancement system: numbers get big.
- Short scoped game loop: party grows, so does danger.
